 * > Rules is a feature that is currently in development and enabled on an opt-in basis for early access. To have this enabled for your organization for utilizing this data source, please reach out to Buildkite's Support Team.

 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript

 * import * as buildkite from "@pulumiverse/buildkite";
 *
 * // Read an organization rule by its id
 * const dataArtifactsReadDevTest = buildkite.Organization.getRule({
 *     id: artifactsReadDevTest.id,
 * });
 * // Read an organization rule by its uuid
 * const dataArtifactsReadTestDev = buildkite.Organization.getRule({
 *     uuid: artifactsReadTestDev.uuid,
 * });
 * ```
